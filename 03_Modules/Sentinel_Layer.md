Sentinel Layer (C‑OS 3.0)
A continuous awareness system for signals, drift, anomalies, and continuity threats.

1. Purpose
The Sentinel Layer provides always‑on awareness across the entire operating system.
It monitors signals, detects drift, identifies anomalies, and protects continuity.
Where the Pulse System provides rhythm,
the Sentinel Layer provides attention.

2. What the Sentinel Layer Tracks
The Sentinel Layer continuously observes:
2.1 Cognitive Signals
- clarity changes
- focus shifts
- overload indicators
2.2 Emotional Signals
- resonance spikes
- load accumulation
- destabilizing patterns
2.3 Environmental Signals
- context changes
- interruptions
- external threats to continuity
2.4 System Signals
- node imbalance
- pulse irregularities
- drift indicators

3. Core Responsibilities
3.1 Drift Detection
Identify early signs of:
- emotional drift
- cognitive drift
- identity drift
- project drift
3.2 Signal Classification
Every signal is classified as:
- stabilizing
- neutral
- destabilizing
3.3 Continuity Protection
The Sentinel Layer raises alerts when continuity is threatened:
- broken threads
- lost intent
- identity fragmentation
- overload conditions
3.4 Routing to Other Layers
The Sentinel Layer does not act.
It routes:
- to the Pulse System (rhythm correction)
- to the Node Architecture (domain‑specific action)
- to the Drift Engine (correction)
- to the Continuity Layer (long‑arc protection)

4. Sentinel States
The Sentinel Layer operates in three states:
4.1 Passive Awareness
Low‑load monitoring.
Background observation.
No active intervention.
4.2 Active Monitoring
Triggered by:
- emotional spikes
- cognitive load
- environmental change
- node imbalance
4.3 Alert Mode
Triggered when continuity is at risk:
- thread loss
- identity destabilization
- overload
- collapse patterns
Alert Mode routes directly to the Drift Engine.

5. How the Sentinel Layer Interacts with the OS
5.1 With the Pulse System
- detects rhythm irregularities
- triggers pulse resets
- stabilizes daily/seasonal cycles
5.2 With the Node Architecture
- identifies which node is destabilized
- routes signals to the correct domain
5.3 With the Drift Engine
- hands off drift events
- provides signal context
- receives correction confirmation
5.4 With the Continuity Layer
- protects long‑arc identity
- flags continuity threats
- stabilizes trajectory

6. Sentinel Outputs
The Sentinel Layer produces:
- signal logs
- drift alerts
- node imbalance reports
- continuity warnings
- pulse irregularity notices
These outputs feed the rest of the OS.

7. Summary
The Sentinel Layer is the awareness field of C‑OS.
It:
- monitors
- detects
- classifies
- alerts
- routes
It does not act.
It protects.
The Sentinel Layer is the first and most essential module of the operating system.
