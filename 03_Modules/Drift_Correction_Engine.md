Drift Correction Engine (C‑OS 3.0)
A structural correction system that restores alignment across the OS.

1. Purpose
The Drift Correction Engine (DCE) restores stability when any part of the system begins to drift.
Drift can occur in:
- emotion
- cognition
- identity
- projects
- nodes
- rhythms
- environment
The DCE ensures the steward never loses the thread.
Where the Sentinel Layer detects
and the Pulse System stabilizes
and the Node Architecture organizes,
the Drift Correction Engine restores alignment.

2. What Drift Is
Drift is any deviation from:
- clarity
- emotional fidelity
- identity alignment
- project trajectory
- node balance
- continuity
Drift is not failure.
Drift is a signal.
The DCE treats drift as information, not error.

3. Types of Drift
3.1 Emotional Drift
- rising load
- suppressed signals
- resonance mismatch
- emotional artifacts
3.2 Cognitive Drift
- scattered focus
- contradictory reasoning
- overload
- loss of clarity
3.3 Identity Drift
- disconnection from purpose
- loss of meaning
- fragmentation
- narrative collapse
3.4 Project Drift
- stalled movement
- unclear next steps
- misaligned priorities
- scope confusion
3.5 Node Drift
- imbalance
- neglect
- overload
- mis‑routing of attention
3.6 Rhythm Drift
- missed pulses
- irregular cycles
- disrupted cadence

4. Core Responsibilities
4.1 Receive Drift Alerts
The DCE receives alerts from:
- Sentinel Layer
- Pulse System
- Nodes
- Continuity Layer
4.2 Diagnose Drift
The DCE identifies:
- type of drift
- severity
- source
- affected nodes
- continuity risk
4.3 Apply Correction
Corrections may include:
- emotional resets
- cognitive reframing
- node rebalancing
- rhythm adjustments
- project realignment
4.4 Confirm Stability
The DCE verifies:
- drift resolved
- signals normalized
- continuity restored
4.5 Log the Event
Every drift event becomes part of the OS’s long‑arc learning.

5. Drift Correction Flow
Every correction follows the same four‑step flow:
5.1 Detect
A drift signal is received.
5.2 Diagnose
The DCE identifies what kind of drift it is.
5.3 Correct
The DCE applies the appropriate correction.
5.4 Stabilize
The DCE confirms the system has returned to alignment.
This universal flow keeps the OS predictable and stable.

6. Drift Severity Levels
6.1 Level 1 — Mild Drift
- slight imbalance
- early signals
- easy correction
6.2 Level 2 — Moderate Drift
- noticeable disruption
- multiple nodes affected
- requires structured correction
6.3 Level 3 — Severe Drift
- continuity threatened
- identity destabilizing
- requires immediate correction
Severe drift triggers Alert Mode in the Sentinel Layer.

7. How the DCE Interacts with the OS
7.1 With the Sentinel Layer
- receives drift alerts
- sends correction confirmations
7.2 With the Pulse System
- adjusts rhythms
- stabilizes cycles
7.3 With the Node Architecture
- rebalances nodes
- routes domain‑specific corrections
7.4 With the Continuity Layer
- protects long‑arc identity
- prevents fragmentation

8. Outputs
The DCE produces:
- drift reports
- correction logs
- stability confirmations
- continuity markers
- node rebalancing instructions
These outputs feed the entire OS.

9. Summary
The Drift Correction Engine is the stabilizer of C‑OS.
It:
- detects
- diagnoses
- corrects
- stabilizes
- preserves continuity
Where the Sentinel Layer watches,
the Pulse System keeps time,
and the Node Architecture gives form,
the Drift Correction Engine keeps everything aligned.
