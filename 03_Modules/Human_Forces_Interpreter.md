Human‑Forces Interpreter (C‑OS 3.0)
A translation layer that converts human emotional and somatic signals into structured, actionable meaning.

1. Purpose
The Human‑Forces Interpreter (HFI) is the bridge between human experience and system structure.
It translates:
- emotional signals
- somatic sensations
- intuitive impressions
- resonance patterns
- environmental feelings
into structured information the OS can use.
Where the Sentinel Layer watches
and the Pulse System keeps time
and the Node Architecture organizes
and the Drift Engine corrects,
the Human‑Forces Interpreter understands the human.

2. What Human Forces Are
Human forces are the internal, often non‑verbal signals that shape:
- decisions
- identity
- emotional states
- meaning
- direction
- continuity
These forces include:
2.1 Emotional Forces
- resonance
- load
- fidelity
- emotional signatures
2.2 Somatic Forces
- tension
- grounding
- energy shifts
- bodily cues
2.3 Intuitive Forces
- pattern recognition
- gut signals
- anticipatory sense
- subtle warnings
2.4 Environmental Forces
- place‑based feelings
- land frequency
- context shifts
- relational atmosphere
The HFI treats these forces as data, not noise.

3. Core Responsibilities
3.1 Signal Intake
The HFI receives raw human signals from:
- the body
- the emotional field
- intuition
- environment
- relational context
3.2 Interpretation
The HFI translates these signals into:
- meaning
- direction
- warnings
- opportunities
- adjustments
3.3 Classification
Every human‑force signal is classified as:
- stabilizing
- neutral
- destabilizing
3.4 Routing
The HFI routes interpreted signals to:
- Sentinel Layer (awareness)
- Pulse System (rhythm adjustment)
- Node Architecture (domain relevance)
- Drift Engine (correction)
- Continuity Layer (identity alignment)
3.5 Fidelity Protection
The HFI ensures emotional truth is preserved, not overwritten.

4. Human‑Force Categories
4.1 Resonance Signals
Indicate alignment, truth, or structural fit.
4.2 Load Signals
Indicate emotional weight, overwhelm, or pressure.
4.3 Drift Signals
Indicate misalignment, fragmentation, or loss of clarity.
4.4 Identity Signals
Indicate meaning, purpose, or long‑arc direction.
4.5 Environmental Signals
Indicate safety, threat, opportunity, or context shift.

5. Interpretation Flow
Every human‑force interpretation follows the same four‑step flow:
5.1 Sense
What is being felt?
5.2 Name
What type of force is it?
5.3 Understand
What does it mean?
5.4 Route
Where does it need to go in the OS?
This universal flow keeps the system consistent and grounded.

6. How the HFI Interacts with the OS
6.1 With the Sentinel Layer
- provides emotional and somatic context
- enhances drift detection
- enriches signal classification
6.2 With the Pulse System
- influences rhythm adjustments
- shapes daily/weekly/seasonal pulses
- stabilizes emotional cycles
6.3 With the Node Architecture
- identifies which node a human signal belongs to
- prevents mis‑routing of emotional load
6.4 With the Drift Engine
- provides human‑force context for drift events
- helps determine severity and correction type
6.5 With the Continuity Layer
- protects identity
- preserves emotional truth
- maintains long‑arc meaning

7. Outputs
The HFI produces:
- emotional fidelity markers
- resonance maps
- load indicators
- identity signals
- environmental interpretations
- routing instructions
These outputs allow the OS to understand the human side of continuity.

8. Summary
The Human‑Forces Interpreter is the emotional and somatic intelligence of C‑OS.
It:
- senses
- interprets
- classifies
- routes
- protects fidelity
Where the Sentinel Layer watches,
the Pulse System keeps time,
the Node Architecture gives form,
and the Drift Engine aligns,
the Human‑Forces Interpreter makes the OS human‑aware.
