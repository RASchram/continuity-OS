Pulse System (C‑OS 3.0)
A multi‑rhythm system that stabilizes identity, emotion, and continuity across time.

1. Purpose
The Pulse System provides the rhythmic structure that keeps the operating system stable across:
- days
- weeks
- seasons
- long‑arc cycles
Where the Sentinel Layer provides awareness,
the Pulse System provides cadence.
It prevents drift by giving the steward predictable, repeating touchpoints that anchor identity and meaning.

2. Pulse Types
The Pulse System operates across four temporal layers:
2.1 Daily Pulse
Short‑arc stabilization.
Tracks:
- clarity
- emotional fidelity
- system load
- environmental context
Outputs:
- AM Pulse (tactical clarity)
- PM Pulse (integration and reflection)
2.2 Weekly Pulse
Medium‑arc stabilization.
Tracks:
- project movement
- node balance
- emotional cycles
- continuity alignment
Outputs:
- Weekly Review
- Weekly Reset
2.3 Seasonal Pulse
Long‑arc stabilization.
Tracks:
- identity shifts
- environmental cycles
- homestead rhythms
- emotional seasons
Outputs:
- Seasonal Reset
- Seasonal Planning Map
2.4 Long‑Arc Pulse
Multi‑year stabilization.
Tracks:
- life trajectory
- generational movement
- identity arc
- stewardship path
Outputs:
- Long‑Arc Review
- Continuity Trajectory Map

3. Core Responsibilities
3.1 Rhythm Stabilization
The Pulse System ensures the steward never drifts too far without a structural check‑in.
3.2 Emotional Coherence
Each pulse includes emotional fidelity scanning to maintain alignment.
3.3 Node Synchronization
Pulses check whether major life domains (nodes) are:
- balanced
- overloaded
- neglected
- drifting
3.4 Continuity Anchoring
Pulses reinforce:
- identity
- purpose
- direction
- meaning
3.5 Drift Prevention
The Pulse System catches drift early by:
- comparing pulses
- detecting irregularities
- identifying missing rhythms

4. Pulse Structure
Every pulse — regardless of scale — follows the same structure:
4.1 Scan
What is true right now?
4.2 Interpret
What does it mean?
4.3 Adjust
What needs to shift?
4.4 Anchor
What stabilizes the next cycle?
This universal structure keeps the OS consistent across time.

5. Pulse Outputs
Each pulse produces:
- a snapshot of the system
- emotional fidelity notes
- node balance indicators
- continuity alignment markers
- drift warnings
- recommended adjustments
These outputs feed:
- the Sentinel Layer
- the Node Architecture
- the Drift Engine
- the Continuity Layer

6. How the Pulse System Interacts with the OS
6.1 With the Sentinel Layer
- receives signal alerts
- adjusts rhythm based on anomalies
- stabilizes after drift events
6.2 With the Node Architecture
- checks node balance
- identifies overloaded or neglected nodes
- routes adjustments
6.3 With the Drift Engine
- provides rhythm context
- receives correction instructions
- stabilizes post‑correction
6.4 With the Continuity Layer
- reinforces long‑arc identity
- maintains trajectory
- anchors meaning across cycles

7. Summary
The Pulse System is the rhythm engine of C‑OS.
It:
- stabilizes
- synchronizes
- aligns
- anchors
- prevents drift
Where the Sentinel Layer watches,
the Pulse System keeps time.
