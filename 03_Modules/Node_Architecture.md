Node Architecture (C‑OS 3.0)
A modular domain system that organizes life into stable, expandable nodes.

1. Purpose
The Node Architecture provides the structural map of life.
It divides the steward’s world into modular, independent, interconnected nodes, each representing a major domain.
Nodes allow C‑OS to:
- scale
- organize
- stabilize
- route signals
- prevent overload
- maintain clarity
Where the Sentinel Layer watches
and the Pulse System keeps time,
the Node Architecture gives shape.

2. What a Node Is
A node is a self‑contained domain with:
- a purpose
- boundaries
- signals
- responsibilities
- rhythms
- interactions with other nodes
Nodes are modular — they can be added, removed, or expanded without destabilizing the OS.

3. Core Node Types
C‑OS defines several primary nodes:
3.1 Identity Node
Tracks identity, meaning, emotional fidelity, and long‑arc selfhood.
3.2 Homestead Node
Tracks land, property, infrastructure, ecology, and physical environment.
3.3 Digital Life Node
Tracks digital systems, accounts, tools, and information flows.
3.4 Relationship Node
Tracks partnership, family, community, and social continuity.
3.5 Stewardship Node
Tracks generational responsibility, teaching, and transmission.
3.6 Project Nodes
Each major project becomes its own node with:
- scope
- timeline
- dependencies
- signals
- risks
3.7 Land & Ecology Nodes
For stewards with land, these nodes track:
- wildlife
- water
- soil
- seasons
- ecological rhythms
Nodes can be added as needed.

4. Node Responsibilities
4.1 Maintain Domain Clarity
Each node defines:
- what belongs
- what does not belong
- what signals matter
- what actions are required
4.2 Track Signals
Nodes receive signals from:
- the Sentinel Layer
- the Pulse System
- other nodes
- the environment
4.3 Manage Load
Nodes track:
- overload
- neglect
- imbalance
- drift
4.4 Provide Structure
Nodes give the steward:
- boundaries
- clarity
- focus
- organization
4.5 Route Information
Nodes send and receive:
- alerts
- updates
- adjustments
- continuity markers

5. Node States
Each node operates in one of three states:
5.1 Stable
Signals normal.
Load balanced.
Rhythm aligned.
5.2 Imbalanced
Signals irregular.
Load uneven.
Attention required.
5.3 Drifting
Signals destabilizing.
Load accumulating.
Continuity at risk.
Drifting nodes are routed to the Drift Engine.

6. Node Interactions
6.1 With the Sentinel Layer
- receives drift alerts
- sends domain‑specific signals
- reports anomalies
6.2 With the Pulse System
- receives rhythm adjustments
- reports cycle alignment
- syncs with daily/weekly/seasonal pulses
6.3 With the Drift Engine
- hands off drift events
- receives correction instructions
6.4 With the Continuity Layer
- contributes to long‑arc identity
- maintains generational alignment

7. Node Outputs
Each node produces:
- domain snapshots
- load indicators
- drift warnings
- continuity markers
- recommended actions
These outputs feed the rest of the OS.

8. Summary
The Node Architecture is the structural backbone of C‑OS.
It:
- organizes life
- stabilizes complexity
- prevents overload
- routes signals
- maintains clarity
- supports continuity
Where the Sentinel Layer watches
and the Pulse System keeps time,
the Node Architecture gives form.
