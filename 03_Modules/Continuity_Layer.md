Continuity Layer (C‑OS 3.0)
A long‑arc stabilizer that protects identity, meaning, and trajectory across time.

1. Purpose
The Continuity Layer preserves the long‑arc thread of the steward’s life.
It ensures that:
- identity remains coherent
- meaning remains intact
- direction remains aligned
- purpose remains visible
- generational intent remains stable
Where the Sentinel Layer watches
and the Pulse System keeps time
and the Node Architecture organizes
and the Drift Engine aligns
and the Human‑Forces Interpreter understands,
the Continuity Layer remembers.

2. What Continuity Is
Continuity is the persistent thread that connects:
- past
- present
- future
It is the structure that holds:
- identity
- purpose
- meaning
- trajectory
- lineage
Continuity is not memory.
Continuity is identity across time.

3. Core Responsibilities
3.1 Identity Preservation
The Continuity Layer protects:
- who the steward is
- who they are becoming
- who they refuse to become
3.2 Meaning Stabilization
It ensures that meaning does not collapse under:
- stress
- drift
- overload
- emotional turbulence
3.3 Trajectory Tracking
It tracks the long‑arc path:
- where the steward is going
- why they are going there
- how each cycle contributes
3.4 Generational Alignment
It maintains:
- lineage
- inheritance
- stewardship
- transmission
3.5 Continuity Protection
It raises alerts when continuity is threatened:
- identity fragmentation
- purpose loss
- narrative collapse
- long‑arc drift

4. Continuity Anchors
The Continuity Layer uses anchors to stabilize the long arc:
4.1 Identity Anchors
- core values
- lived truths
- emotional fidelity markers
4.2 Purpose Anchors
- long‑arc goals
- generational intent
- stewardship commitments
4.3 Narrative Anchors
- life story
- mythic framing
- meaning arcs
4.4 Temporal Anchors
- seasonal cycles
- long‑arc pulses
- major transitions
These anchors prevent fragmentation.

5. Continuity Flow
Every continuity cycle follows the same structure:
5.1 Recall
What is the long‑arc thread?
5.2 Align
Is the steward still on it?
5.3 Adjust
What needs to shift?
5.4 Reinforce
What anchors must be strengthened?
This flow keeps the steward aligned across years and decades.

6. How the Continuity Layer Interacts with the OS
6.1 With the Sentinel Layer
- receives continuity threat alerts
- provides long‑arc context for signals
6.2 With the Pulse System
- shapes long‑arc pulses
- stabilizes seasonal and yearly rhythms
6.3 With the Node Architecture
- ensures nodes support the long arc
- identifies nodes that contradict identity
6.4 With the Drift Engine
- receives correction for continuity drift
- confirms long‑arc stability post‑correction
6.5 With the Human‑Forces Interpreter
- integrates emotional truth into identity
- preserves fidelity across time

7. Outputs
The Continuity Layer produces:
- identity alignment reports
- long‑arc trajectory maps
- continuity markers
- generational alignment indicators
- narrative stability notes
These outputs guide the entire OS.

8. Summary
The Continuity Layer is the heart of C‑OS.
It:
- preserves identity
- stabilizes meaning
- protects trajectory
- anchors purpose
- maintains lineage
Where the Sentinel Layer watches,
the Pulse System keeps time,
the Node Architecture gives form,
the Drift Engine aligns,
and the Human‑Forces Interpreter understands,
the Continuity Layer ensures it all matters across time.
