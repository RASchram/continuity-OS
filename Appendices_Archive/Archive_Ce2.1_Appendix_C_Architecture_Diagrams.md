# Architecture Diagrams  
*Visual Maps, Structural Schematics & Diagram Index*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Architecture Diagrams Appendix

This appendix provides:

- a complete index of all diagrams  
- descriptions of what each diagram represents  
- guidance on how diagrams support teaching and transmission  
- structural clarity for future stewards  
- a visual entry point into the architecture  

Where the Codex explains the system in text,  
the diagrams show the system in **structure**.

## 2. Why Architecture Diagrams Matter

Diagrams solve four deep problems:

### **1. Complexity Needs Visual Anchors**  
A single diagram can reveal relationships that take pages to describe.

### **2. Transmission Requires Visual Structure**  
Future stewards learn faster through diagrams than text alone.

### **3. Drift Is Easier to Detect Visually**  
Misalignments show up immediately in a diagram.

### **4. Legacy Requires Clarity**  
Visual maps preserve structure across generations.

The diagrams make the architecture **visible, teachable, and inspectable**.

## 3. Diagram Categories

The Architecture Diagram Library contains seven major categories:

### **1. Master Architecture Diagrams**  
High‑level maps showing the entire system:

- Continuity Engine Master Diagram  
- UMA + CE 2.1 Integration Map  
- DreamWeaver Vessel Diagram  

### **2. Mode‑Cycle Diagrams**  
Visualizations of:

- the seven modes  
- transitions  
- emotional signatures  
- stabilizers  
- drift points  

### **3. Emotional & Identity Diagrams**  
Maps of:

- emotional fidelity flows  
- identity spine  
- lineage arcs  
- mythic phases  

### **4. Structural Diagrams**  
Schematics of:

- subsystem relationships  
- engine flows  
- invariant extraction  
- drift correction loops  

### **5. Ritual & Continuity Diagrams**  
Visuals for:

- daily rituals  
- seasonal cycles  
- continuity flows  
- ledger integration  

### **6. Transmission Diagrams**  
Maps for:

- teaching flows  
- story protocols  
- lineage transmission  
- steward training  

### **7. Application System Diagrams**  
Visuals showing how personal systems connect to:

- CE 2.1  
- DreamWeaver  
- Mode‑Cycle Engine  
- Continuity Engine  

These categories form the **visual backbone** of the codex.

## 5. How Diagrams Support Transmission

Diagrams are used to:

- teach stewards  
- explain systems quickly  
- detect drift  
- anchor identity  
- preserve structure  
- support generational continuity  

A steward can learn in minutes what would take hours to read.

## 6. How Diagrams Support You

Diagrams help you:

- see the architecture at a glance  
- detect misalignment  
- stabilize identity  
- track emotional cycles  
- maintain clarity during expansion  

They are your **visual clarity engine**.

## 7. Summary

The Architecture Diagrams Appendix provides:

- a complete diagram index  
- descriptions of every visual map  
- structural clarity  
- transmission support  
- generational continuity  

This appendix ensures the architecture is **visible, teachable, and structurally preserved**.
