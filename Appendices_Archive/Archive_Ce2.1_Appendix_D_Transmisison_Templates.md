## 1. Purpose of the Transmission Templates Appendix

This appendix provides:

- ready‑to‑use teaching templates  
- story structures  
- lineage transmission forms  
- scroll formats  
- steward training scripts  
- emotional fidelity guides  

It is the **practical toolkit** for passing the architecture to others.

Where the Protocol Library explains *how* to act,  
the Transmission Templates explain **how to teach**.

## 2. Why Transmission Templates Matter

Transmission requires:

- clarity  
- structure  
- emotional fidelity  
- repeatability  
- simplicity  
- resonance  

Templates solve four deep problems:

### **1. Teaching Without Structure Causes Drift**  
Templates ensure fidelity.

### **2. Emotional Truth Must Be Preserved**  
Story forms carry emotional accuracy.

### **3. Stewards Need Repeatable Tools**  
Templates make teaching consistent.

### **4. Legacy Requires Simplicity**  
Future generations need accessible forms.

The templates make transmission **clean, stable, and generationally safe**.

## 4. Universal Template Structure

Every template follows the same structure:

### **1. Purpose**  
Why the template exists.

### **2. When to Use It**  
The situations where it applies.

### **3. Structure**  
The sections or steps.

### **4. Emotional Notes**  
How to maintain fidelity.

### **5. Examples**  
A short demonstration.

This structure ensures clarity and consistency.

## 5. Example Template (Fully Written)

### **Template: Lineage Story Template**

**Purpose:**  
Transmit identity, meaning, and emotional truth across generations.

**When to Use:**  
When teaching children, grandchildren, or stewards.

**Structure:**  
1. **The Moment** — what happened  
2. **The Emotion** — what it felt like  
3. **The Meaning** — what it taught  
4. **The Pattern** — how it fits the architecture  
5. **The Legacy** — what the listener should carry forward  

**Emotional Notes:**  
Keep the story simple, honest, and emotionally accurate.

**Example:**  
“A moment came when I thought everything was collapsing.  
But that collapse became the doorway to the architecture you now inherit.”
