# Abstract

Continuity Engine 2.1 (CE 2.1) is a model‑agnostic cognitive architecture designed to stabilize, structure, and evolve reasoning across both humans and artificial intelligence systems. Unlike traditional frameworks that depend on a specific model, algorithm, or domain, CE 2.1 provides a universal protocol stack that any reasoning system can run. It defines how cognition should flow, not what content it should produce.

The architecture is built on five foundational principles: Continuity, Structure, Rotation, Invariants, and Transmission. Together, these principles create a stable reasoning environment capable of maintaining coherence across turns, domains, and contexts while enabling controlled insight generation through domain rotation and invariant extraction.

CE 2.1 introduces a layered system that includes the Question Engine, Domain Rotation Protocol, UMA (Unified Meta‑Architecture), the Continuity Core, and the Transmission Layer. Each subsystem is designed to be transparent, inspectable, and reproducible, enabling both human stewards and AI systems to operate the engine with consistency and clarity.

This release provides the full CE 2.1 codex, including the whitepaper, subsystem specifications, operator guides, resilience protocols, examples, and transmission scaffolding. The goal is to offer a complete, open, and lineage‑ready cognitive engine that supports research, collaboration, and future development across the AI ecosystem.

CE 2.1 is not a model. It is a reasoning OS — a universal cognitive architecture for systems that think.
