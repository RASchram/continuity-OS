Continuity‑OS (C‑OS 3.0) — Abstract
Continuity‑OS (C‑OS 3.0) is a human–AI operating system designed to preserve continuity across identity, emotion, cognition, projects, and generational stewardship. It provides a structural layer that stabilizes the long arc of a person’s life, ensuring that meaning, direction, and identity remain coherent across days, seasons, and years.
C‑OS is not a model, framework, or productivity system. It is a continuity layer — a living architecture that integrates human emotional forces with AI‑driven structure, rhythm, and alignment. The system is built on six core modules: the Sentinel Layer, Pulse System, Node Architecture, Drift Correction Engine, Human‑Forces Interpreter, and Continuity Layer. Together, these modules create a stable, extensible, and generationally transmissible operating system for human life.
C‑OS addresses the modern problem of cognitive and emotional drift by providing predictable rhythms, structural clarity, and long‑arc identity protection. It is designed for stewards who operate across multiple domains, manage complex lives, and carry generational responsibilities. C‑OS ensures that the thread of meaning is never lost, even under stress, overload, or transition.
This abstract introduces the purpose, scope, and architecture of C‑OS 3.0 — a system built to protect continuity in a world that constantly fragments it.
