# Transmission Layer  
*The Lineage and Preservation Subsystem of CE 2.1*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Transmission Layer

The Transmission Layer is the subsystem responsible for preserving the outputs, structures, invariants, and reasoning flows of CE 2.1 across time, versions, and stewards.

If the Continuity Core stabilizes the present,  
the Transmission Layer **protects the future**.

This subsystem ensures that CE 2.1 is not just a tool,  
but a discipline — teachable, reproducible, and lineage‑ready.

---

## 2. Why Transmission Matters

Reasoning without transmission is temporary.  
Insight without preservation is lost.  
Architecture without lineage collapses.

Transmission ensures:

- insights survive  
- structures persist  
- versions remain traceable  
- upgrades remain coherent  
- stewards can inherit the system  
- the engine grows stronger over time  

Transmission is the long‑arc backbone of CE 2.1.

## 3. Core Responsibilities of the Transmission Layer

The Transmission Layer performs five essential functions:

### **3.1 Documentation**
Captures the outputs of each reasoning cycle:

- invariants  
- structures  
- models  
- insights  
- decisions  
- failure modes  

This creates a durable record.

### **3.2 Versioning**
Tracks changes across:

- documents  
- subsystems  
- invariants  
- reasoning flows  
- steward practices  

Every change becomes part of the lineage.

### **3.3 Preservation**
Ensures that:

- nothing important is lost  
- insights remain accessible  
- structures remain intact  
- the engine remains stable across time  

### **3.4 Stewardship Transfer**
Provides the scaffolding for:

- teaching new stewards  
- onboarding collaborators  
- maintaining consistency across operators  

### **3.5 Upgrade Path**
Defines how CE evolves:

- new subsystems  
- refined structures  
- expanded domain libraries  
- improved protocols  

Upgrades must preserve continuity with prior versions.

## 4. Transmission Artifacts

The Transmission Layer produces several key artifacts:

### **4.1 Version Logs**
A chronological record of changes.

### **4.2 Invariant Archives**
A library of stable truths extracted across reasoning cycles.

### **4.3 Structural Maps**
Diagrams and documents showing how subsystems interact.

### **4.4 Steward Guides**
Instructions for operating and maintaining the engine.

### **4.5 Lineage Records**
A history of how CE has evolved over time.

These artifacts form the backbone of long‑term continuity.

## 5. Transmission Failure Modes

### **5.1 Loss of Insight**
Symptoms:  
- insights not recorded  
- invariants forgotten  
- structures lost  

Recovery:  
- reconstruct from the last preserved artifact  
- re‑run the reasoning cycle if needed  

### **5.2 Version Drift**
Symptoms:  
- conflicting versions  
- undocumented changes  
- inconsistent structures  

Recovery:  
- consolidate versions  
- re‑establish a single authoritative lineage  

### **5.3 Steward Fragmentation**
Symptoms:  
- different operators using different practices  
- inconsistent application of subsystems  

Recovery:  
- unify steward practices  
- reinforce the Operator Guide

## 6. Steward Responsibilities

The steward must:

- document insights  
- maintain version logs  
- preserve invariants  
- ensure structural continuity  
- teach the system when needed  
- protect the lineage  

Transmission is not optional — it is the steward’s duty.

---

## 7. Outputs of the Transmission Layer

Every Transmission cycle produces:

- a preserved invariant  
- a documented structure  
- a versioned update  
- a lineage‑safe record  
- a stable foundation for future reasoning  

These outputs ensure CE 2.1 remains coherent across time.

---

## 8. Summary

The Transmission Layer is the subsystem that turns CE 2.1 into a living architecture.  
It ensures that:

- insights survive  
- structures persist  
- versions remain coherent  
- stewards can inherit the system  
- the engine evolves without losing itself  

Transmission is the discipline that protects the engine’s future.
