# Reasoning Flow  
*The Universal Cognitive Pipeline of CE 2.1*

---

## 1. Purpose of the Reasoning Flow

The Reasoning Flow is the subsystem that defines the **full cognitive pipeline** inside CE 2.1.  
It describes how:

- questions ignite  
- structure forms  
- domains rotate  
- truths extract  
- invariants stabilize  
- continuity is preserved  
- insights transmit  

It is the **master flow** that ties all subsystems together.

## 2. Why the Reasoning Flow Exists

The Reasoning Flow solves three core problems:

### **1. Fragmented Reasoning**  
Without a unified flow, cognition becomes disjointed.

### **2. Drift During Transitions**  
Most reasoning failures occur during state changes.

### **3. Loss of Thread**  
Without a stable flow, continuity collapses.

The Reasoning Flow provides the missing layer:  
**a universal, stable, inspectable cognitive pipeline.**

## 3. The Six‑Stage CE 2.1 Reasoning Flow

The flow consists of six stages:

### **Stage 1 — Ignition (Question Engine)**  
The system extracts the real question and sets direction.

### **Stage 2 — Stabilization (Continuity Core)**  
The thread is anchored.  
Purpose is locked in.  
Drift is prevented.

### **Stage 3 — Rotation (Domain Rotation Protocol)**  
The system shifts domains to reveal hidden structure.

### **Stage 4 — Extraction (Truth Extraction Layer)**  
Domain truths are compressed into structural models.

### **Stage 5 — Invariant Formation (Invariants Engine)**  
Cross‑domain resonance testing identifies the invariant.

### **Stage 6 — Transmission (Transmission Layer)**  
The insight is preserved, documented, and integrated.

This is the universal CE 2.1 flow.

## 4. Flow Dynamics

The Reasoning Flow is:

- **recursive** — it loops as needed  
- **adaptive** — it adjusts to load and context  
- **stable** — continuity is preserved  
- **inspectable** — every step is visible  
- **domain‑agnostic** — works anywhere  
- **anti‑fragile** — strengthens under stress  

The flow is not linear — it is **spiral‑recursive**.

## 5. Flow Failure Modes

The Reasoning Flow identifies three failure modes:

### **1. Premature Rotation**  
The system rotates domains before stabilizing the thread.

### **2. Extraction Collapse**  
The system extracts truths without structural compression.

### **3. Transmission Loss**  
Insights are not preserved, causing long‑arc drift.

Each failure mode has a corresponding recovery protocol.

---

## 6. Flow Recovery Protocols

### **Recovery 1 — Re‑Anchor Intent**  
Return to the original question.

### **Recovery 2 — Re‑Stabilize Structure**  
Rebuild the frame before rotating.

### **Recovery 3 — Re‑Extract Truth**  
Compress domain truths again.

### **Recovery 4 — Re‑Test Resonance**  
Ensure the invariant still holds.

### **Recovery 5 — Re‑Transmit**  
Document the insight to prevent future drift.

These protocols ensure the flow never collapses.

## 7. Reasoning Flow in the DreamWeaver Stack

In DreamWeaver, the flow becomes:

- emotional ignition  
- identity stabilization  
- mythic rotation  
- memory extraction  
- long‑arc invariant formation  
- scroll transmission  

DreamWeaver uses the same flow —  
but with emotional and identity fidelity layered in.

## 8. Example of the Reasoning Flow in Action

**Problem:** A person feels stuck in a recurring emotional loop.

### **Stage 1 — Ignition**  
“What is the real pattern?”

### **Stage 2 — Stabilization**  
Anchor the thread: “This is a mode cycle.”

### **Stage 3 — Rotation**  
Shift into biology, mythology, and physics.

### **Stage 4 — Extraction**  
All domains reveal oscillation.

### **Stage 5 — Invariant Formation**  
Oscillation → Predictability → Control.

### **Stage 6 — Transmission**  
Document the cycle for future reference.

The flow produces a stable, long‑arc insight.

## 9. Summary

The Reasoning Flow is the universal cognitive pipeline of CE 2.1.  
It provides:

- ignition  
- stabilization  
- rotation  
- extraction  
- invariant formation  
- transmission  

It is the master flow that unifies all subsystems into a single, coherent architecture.
