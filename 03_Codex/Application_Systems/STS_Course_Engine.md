# STS Course Engine  
*Your Structured Skill Transmission & Continuity Teaching Architecture*

---

## 1. Purpose of the STS Course Engine

The STS Course Engine is the subsystem that transforms your cognitive architecture into **teachable, repeatable, lineage‑ready instruction**.

It governs:

- course design  
- skill sequencing  
- narrative framing  
- emotional pacing  
- structural clarity  
- student continuity  
- long‑arc transmission  

Where CE 2.1 is the reasoning engine,  
and DreamWeaver is the personal vessel,  
the STS Course Engine is the **teaching interface**.

It ensures your knowledge becomes **transferable**.

## 2. Why the STS Course Engine Exists

The STS Course Engine solves four deep problems:

### **1. Skills Are Not Just Techniques**  
They are identity, rhythm, and structure.

### **2. Students Need Continuity, Not Content**  
Information alone does not create mastery.

### **3. Teaching Requires Emotional Pacing**  
Students collapse if the emotional load is mismatched.

### **4. Transmission Requires Structure**  
Legacy cannot be taught without a stable architecture.

The STS Course Engine ensures your teaching becomes **continuity‑driven**.

## 3. STS Course Engine Architecture

The system is built from six subsystems:

### **1. Skill Decomposition Engine**  
Breaks skills into:

- primitives  
- micro‑skills  
- structural invariants  
- emotional requirements  
- environmental dependencies  

### **2. Sequence Engine**  
Orders skills based on:

- cognitive load  
- emotional pacing  
- structural prerequisites  
- student mode‑cycles  

### **3. Narrative Engine**  
Frames skills inside:

- story  
- meaning  
- identity  
- lineage  
- mythic structure  

### **4. Continuity Engine**  
Ensures each lesson:

- connects to the previous  
- sets up the next  
- preserves the long‑arc thread  

### **5. Emotional Pacing Engine**  
Manages:

- overwhelm  
- collapse risk  
- confidence cycles  
- student drift  

### **6. Transmission Engine**  
Packages the course for:

- video  
- text  
- scrolls  
- rituals  
- lineage artifacts  

The STS Course Engine is a **full teaching OS**.

## 4. The STS Teaching Flow

The engine follows a five‑phase flow:

### **Phase 1 — Anchor**  
Establish identity, purpose, and meaning.

### **Phase 2 — Structure**  
Introduce the invariant or structural model behind the skill.

### **Phase 3 — Demonstrate**  
Show the skill in action with emotional fidelity.

### **Phase 4 — Decompose**  
Break the skill into micro‑skills and invariants.

### **Phase 5 — Integrate**  
Bind the skill into identity, ritual, and long‑arc continuity.

This flow ensures students **become** the skill, not just learn it.

## 5. STS Course Engine and DreamWeaver

DreamWeaver provides:

- emotional fidelity  
- identity continuity  
- mode‑cycle prediction  
- drift detection  

The STS Course Engine provides:

- structure  
- sequence  
- narrative  
- transmission  

DreamWeaver is the vessel.  
The STS Course Engine is the **teaching interface**.

## 6. STS Course Engine and CE 2.1

CE 2.1 provides:

- reasoning  
- invariants  
- rotation  
- extraction  
- continuity  

The STS Course Engine provides:

- pedagogy  
- pacing  
- narrative  
- skill decomposition  

CE 2.1 is the mind.  
The STS Course Engine is the **classroom**.

---

## 7. Example of the STS Course Engine in Action

**Skill:** Lighting a wood stove (e.g., Vermont Castings Defiant).

### **STS Process:**

- **Anchor:** “Fire is resilience, warmth, and continuity.”  
- **Structure:** combustion invariants → heat, oxygen, fuel.  
- **Demonstrate:** show the stove, the draft, the kindling.  
- **Decompose:** micro‑skills → stacking, airflow, timing.  
- **Integrate:** ritual → morning fire as identity anchor.  

The skill becomes **identity**, not just technique.

## 8. Summary

The STS Course Engine is your architecture for teaching skills with continuity, meaning, and structure.  
It provides:

- skill decomposition  
- sequencing  
- narrative framing  
- emotional pacing  
- continuity preservation  
- generational transmission  

The STS Course Engine turns teaching into **legacy**.
