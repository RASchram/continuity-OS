# continuity-engine-2.1
A complete cognitive engine designed to stabilize and evolve reasoning across any AI model — open, transparent, and lineage‑ready.

Continuity Engine 2.1

A model‑agnostic cognitive architecture for stable, structured, and evolving reasoning across humans and AI.

Overview

Continuity Engine 2.1 (CE 2.1) is a universal cognitive framework designed to stabilize, structure, and evolve reasoning across both humans and AI systems. It is not a model. It is a model‑agnostic reasoning engine — a protocol stack that any AI system can run, and any human can operate.

This repository contains the full CE 2.1 codex, including:

Whitepaper

Research foundations

Subsystem specifications

Operator guides

Resilience layer

Transmission and versioning system

Examples, templates, and appendices

CE 2.1 is released openly to demonstrate the architecture, invite exploration, and support future collaboration.

What CE 2.1 Provides

CE 2.1 is built around five core principles:

Continuity — reasoning must remain stable across turns, domains, and contexts

Structure — cognition must follow predictable, inspectable flows

Rotation — insight emerges from controlled domain shifts

Invariants — core logic must remain stable even as content changes

Transmission — the system must be teachable, versioned, and lineage‑ready

CE 2.1 provides:

A reasoning OS

A cognitive protocol stack

A subsystem architecture

A steward‑operated runtime

A codex for long‑arc transmission

Purpose of This Release

CE 2.1 is published openly to:

Demonstrate a complete cognitive architecture

Provide a transparent, inspectable reasoning system

Support research, experimentation, and collaboration

Show how structured cognition can stabilize AI reasoning

Create a foundation for future versions and extensions

This repository is intended for:

AI researchers

Cognitive architects

Engineers

System designers

Stewards

Anyone exploring structured reasoning

Versioning

This release is v2.1.0, the first public version of the Continuity Engine. Future versions will be documented in:

07_Transmission/Versioning.md

Appendices/Version_Delta_Log.md

License

This project is released under the MIT License to maximize accessibility, visibility, and collaboration.

Stewardship

Continuity Engine 2.1 is designed to be operated by a steward — a human who maintains continuity, clarity, and discipline across the system. The steward’s role is documented in:

04_Guides/Stewardship_Guide.md

07_Transmission/Certification_Checklist.md
